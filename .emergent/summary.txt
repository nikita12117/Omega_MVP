<analysis>
This trajectory details the work of an AI engineer in building and enhancing the 立-Aurora-Codex application, following up on a previous engineer's work. The project involved implementing a sophisticated agent creation system, including a v-9 protocol for advanced prompt transformation, and a user-facing agent history. The engineer successfully integrated OpenRouter for LLM interactions after encountering OpenAI API key issues, and meticulously addressed frontend and backend bugs. Key achievements include the multi-stage agent creation UI, the dynamic v-9 transformation, an agent history page with a rich card view, and a custom long-press animation for the transformation button. The AI demonstrated strong problem-solving and adherence to design guidelines throughout the development process, culminating in a fully functional feature set.

<product_requirements>
The 立-Aurora-Codex MVP aims to be an educational platform and a generative AI demo. Initially, it featured an education section with nine text blocks, and an AI demo pivoting from a 3-stage generative process to a natural chat interface. Authentication evolved from Google OAuth and phone verification to a QR code-based instant demo account with transient access. Key design system, 立-Aurora-Theme, with specific colors, typography, and Shadcn/UI components, was to be adhered to.

Within this trajectory, the product requirements expanded significantly:
- **Agent Creation Flow:** Implement a multi-stage process for users to define and create AI agents.
- **Learning Loop/Master Prompt System:** Integrate a backend system that utilizes a Master Prompt for agent initialization, cognitive architecture, dialog protocols, and output formatting.
- **v-9 Protocol Transformation:** Allow users to transform a basic generated agent prompt into a deeply recursive, self-validating, fractal intelligence system via a dedicated backend endpoint and frontend button. This transformation should add You are now at the start and Language: {users natural language} to the prompt.
- **Agent History:** Implement a My Agents page showing a history of all generated agents, displaying key details in a grid card view.
- **Card View Enhancements:** Agent description in the history card should be a short summary of the best final prompt (v1 or v9). The entire card should be clickable, opening a modal to view agent details with a toggle for v1/v9 versions.
- **Download Functionality:** Allow downloading the agent prompt, named as .
- **Token Tracking:** Display the total combined token cost for agent creation (v1 and v9).
- **Incomplete Agent Filtering:** Do not save or display agents that did not generate a v1 prompt. Implement a backend cleanup for incomplete agents.
- **Long-Press v-9 Transformation Button:** Implement a custom long-press button with a 2-second loading animation (left-to-right gradient fill) for the v-9 Transformace button in both the agent creation process and the history card, serving as a confirmation mechanism.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS,  (for animations), React Router,  (API client).
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database), JWT (authentication), Pydantic (data validation),  (for periodic tasks).
- **LLM Integration:** OpenRouter (used for dynamic LLM model access, resolving OpenAI API key issues).
- **Design System:** 立-Aurora-Theme adherence for UI consistency.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB for data persistence.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully implemented and verified the v-9 Transformace button's long-press animation. This involved creating a new reusable React component, , which handles the 2-second gradient fill animation when the button is pressed. This component was then integrated into both the agent creation flow () for the initial transformation button and the agent history cards () for transforming v1 agents into v9 from the history view.

The animation ensures that during the 2-second press, the button's text (v-9 Transformace initially, then Transformuji...) remains visible, and the button visually loads color from left to right as a confirmation mechanism. Screenshots taken (Chat Message 346) confirmed the animation's initial state, partial fill, and text changes. This final UI enhancement completed all explicit user requests within this trajectory, making the system ready for deployment.
